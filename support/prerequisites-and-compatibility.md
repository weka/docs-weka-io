{% hint style="info" %}
Ensure using an OS with a supported kernel. Do not use an OS with kernel 5.13 for backends in MCB architecture.
{% endhint %}

#### Clients only:

* **SuSe:**&#x20;
  * 15 SP2
  * 12 SP5

{% hint style="info" %}
For kernel 5.13 in clients, do not use applications that use 1GB hugepages.
{% endhint %}

### Configuration

#### General

* All Weka nodes must be synchronized in date/time (NTP recommended)
* A watchdog driver should be installed in /dev/watchdog (hardware watchdog recommended); search the Weka knowledge-base in the [Weka support portal](http://support.weka.io) for more information and how-to articles
* If using `mlocate` or alike, it's advisable to exclude `wekafs` from `updatedb` filesystems lists; search the Weka knowledge-base in the [Weka support portal](http://support.weka.io) for more information and how-to articles

#### SELinux&#x20;

* SELinux is supported in both `permissive` and `enforcing` mode
  * `targeted` policy is supported
  * `mls` policy is not supported yet

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** To set the SELinux security context for files, `-o acl` should be used in the mount command, and `wekafs` should be defined to use extended attributes in the SELinux policy configuration (`fs_use_xattr`).
{% endhint %}

### Kernel

* 5.3-5.13
* 4.4.0-1106 to 4.19
* 3.10

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** It is advisable to turn off auto kernel updates, so it will not get upgraded to an unsupported version.
{% endhint %}

## Weka installation directory

* Directory: `/opt/weka`
* Must be on an SSD or SSD-like performance, for example, M.2.&#x20;
  * Cannot be shared remotely, NFS mounted, or on a RAM drive.
* If there are two boot drives available, it is recommended to dedicate one for the OS and one for the Weka  `/opt/weka` directory (there is no need to set software RAID, and some of its implementations are also known to have issues).
* At least 26 GB is available for the Weka system installation, with an additional 10 GB for each core used by Weka.
* Use a separate filesystem on a separate partition for /opt/weka.

## Networking

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** At least 4k MTU is advised on Weka cluster hosts NICs, and the switches the hosts are connected to.

A Weka system can be configured without jumbo frames for both Ethernet and Infiniband configurations. However, it will provide very limited performance and will not be able to handle high loads of data; please consult the Weka Sales or Support teams before running in this mode.

Jumbo Frames are not required for clients. However, performance might be limited.

## Virtual machines

VMs can be used as clients only, assuming they meet the following prerequisite:

### &#xD;For UDP clients:

* To avoid irregularities, crashes, and inability to handle application load, make sure there is no CPU starvation to the Weka process by both reserving the CPU in the virtual platform and dedicating a core to the Weka client.
* The root filesystem should handle a 3K IOPS load by the Weka client.

### **For DPDK clients (on top of the UDP requirements):**

* The virtual platform interoperability (hypervisor, NICs, CPUs, different versions, etc.) must support DPDK and SR-IOV VFs passthrough to the VM.
* The hypervisor hosts and the client VMs must run the same OFED version.

#### For the VMWare platform:

* If using `vmxnet3` devices, do not enable the SR-IOV feature (which prevents vMotion). Each FrontEnd process requires a `vmxnet3` device and IP, with an additional device and IP per client VM (for the management process).
* Using `vmxnet3` is only supported with core dedication.

For additional information and how-to articles, search the Weka knowledgebase in the [Weka support portal](http://support.weka.io) or contact the Weka support team.

## KMS

* [HashiCorp Vault](https://www.hashicorp.com/products/vault/) (version 1.1.5 up to 1.9.x)
* [KMIP](http://docs.oasis-open.org/kmip/spec/v1.2/os/kmip-spec-v1.2-os.html) compliant KMS (protocol version 1.2 and up)
  * The KMS should support encryption-as-a-service (KMIP encrypt/decrypt APIs)
  * KMIP certification has been conducted with [Equinix SmartKey](https://www.equinix.com/services/edge-services/smartkey/) (powered by [Fortanix KMS](https://fortanix.com/products/sdkms/))
