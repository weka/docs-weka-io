{% hint style="info" %}
Ensure using an OS with a supported kernel. Do not use an OS with kernel 5.13 for backends in MCB architecture.
{% endhint %}

#### Clients only:

* **SuSe:**
  * 15 SP2
  * 12 SP5

{% hint style="info" %}
For kernel 5.13 in clients, do not use applications that use 1GB hugepages.
{% endhint %}

### Configuration

#### General

* All WEKA servers must be synchronized in date/time (NTP recommended)
* A watchdog driver should be installed in /dev/watchdog (hardware watchdog recommended); search the WEKA knowledge base in the [WEKA support portal](http://support.weka.io) for more information and how-to articles.
* If using `mlocate` or alike, it's advisable to exclude `wekafs` from `updatedb` filesystems lists; search the WEKA knowledge base in the [WEKA support portal](http://support.weka.io) for more information and how-to articles.

#### SELinux

* SELinux is supported in both `permissive` and `enforcing` modes.
  * `The targeted` policy is supported.
  * The `mls` policy is not supported yet.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** To set the SELinux security context for files,  use the `-o acl` in the mount command, and define the `wekafs` to use extended attributes in the SELinux policy configuration (`fs_use_xattr`).
{% endhint %}

### Kernel

* 5.3-5.15
* 4.4.0-1106 to 4.19
* 3.10

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Note:** Kernel 5.15 is not supported with Amazon Linux operating systems.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** It is advisable to turn off auto kernel updates so it will not get upgraded to an unsupported version.
{% endhint %}

## Weka installation directory

* Directory: `/opt/weka`
* Must be on an SSD or SSD-like performance, for example, M.2.
  * It cannot be shared remotely, NFS mounted, or on a RAM drive.
* If two boot drives are available, it is recommended to dedicate one for the OS and one for the WEKA `/opt/weka` directory (there is no need to set software RAID, and some of its implementations are also known to have issues).
* At least 26 GB is available for the WEKA system installation, with an additional 10 GB for each core used by WEKA.
* Use a separate filesystem on a separate partition for /opt/weka.

## Networking

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** At least 4k MTU is advised on WEKA cluster servers, NICs, and the switches the servers are connected to.

A WEKA system can be configured without jumbo frames for Ethernet and Infiniband configurations. However, it will provide minimal performance and cannot handle high data loads. Consult with the Customer Success Team before running in this mode.

Jumbo Frames are not required for clients. However, performance might be limited.

## Virtual Machines

Virtual Machines (VMs) can be used as **clients** only. Ensure the following prerequisites are met for the relevant client type:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="UDP clients" %}
* To avoid irregularities, crashes, and inability to handle application load, make sure there is no CPU starvation to the Weka process by reserving the CPU in the virtual platform and dedicating a core to the Weka client.
* The root filesystem must handle a 3K IOPS load by the Weka client.

\

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="DPDK clients" %}
* To avoid irregularities, crashes, and inability to handle application load, make sure there is no CPU starvation to the Weka process by reserving the CPU in the virtual platform and dedicating a core to the Weka client.
* The root filesystem must handle a 3K IOPS load by the Weka client.
* The virtual platform interoperability, such as a hypervisor, NICs, CPUs, and different versions, must support DPDK and virtual network driver.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

<details>

<summary>Special note for a VMware platform</summary>

* If using `vmxnet3` devices, do not enable the SR-IOV feature (which prevents the `vMotion` feature). Each frontend process requires a `vmxnet3` device and IP, with an additional device and IP per client VM (for the management process).
* Using `vmxnet3` is only supported with core dedication.
