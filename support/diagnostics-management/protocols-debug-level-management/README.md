# Protocols debug level management

The cluster enables changing the log debug level (verbosity level) for each protocol container in the cluster. While investigating issues, you can increase the verbosity level.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Do not change protocols debug level without specific instructions from the [Customer Success Team](../../getting-support-for-your-weka-system.md#contact-customer-success-team). Changing the protocols debug level reduces the amount of troubleshooting information about the system and may affect the SLA if an issue occurs.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Once the container is restarted, the log verbosity level reverts to its default.
{% endhint %}
