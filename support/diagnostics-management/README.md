# Diagnostics management

The WEKA system provides diagnostics information about internal processes at various levels. This information helps the Customer Success Team and R\&D to analyze and provide support when troubleshooting is needed.

The WEKA system has the following tools:

* **Traces:** Traces are low-level events collected by an internal tracking tool. The tracking tool collects the traces continuously on the backends and clients.&#x20;
* **Protocols debug level:** The cluster enables changing the log debug level (verbosity level) for each protocol container in the cluster.
* **Diagnostics CLI command**: The diagnostics CLI command is used for collecting and uploading diagnostic data about clusters, servers, and containers for analysis by the Customer Success Team to help with troubleshooting.
