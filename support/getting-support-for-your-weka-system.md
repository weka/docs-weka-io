## Contact Customer Success Team

WEKA provides a 24/7 technical support service according to WEKA's technical support policy (provided on-demand) based on the inquiry classification (severity level).

Choose the classification option to access detailed information and necessary steps for further action.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Critical" %}
The _Critical_ classification is exclusively reserved for critical business systems that hinder the functioning of business operations, leading to decreased productivity or financial losses, and potentially resulting in data loss or corruption.

Do one of the following:

#### **Call WEKA support number: +1 (844) 392-0665**

Leave a voice message, which is directed to the active support personnel.

#### Open a ticket in the Support Portal

To get started, sign up as a user in the Support Portal: [support.weka.io](http://support.weka.io/) (if not done yet). Then, open a ticket and select the _Critical_ classification.

You can monitor tickets and receive timely notifications and updates whenever any changes occur to the tickets.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Major / Minor / Question " %}
For _Major_, _Minor_, and _Question_ classifications, do one of the following:

#### Open a ticket in the Support Portal

To get started, sign up as a user in the Support Portal: [support.weka.io](http://support.weka.io/) (if not done yet). Then, open a ticket and select the appropriate classification according to the issue severity.

You can track tickets and receive notifications and updates when there are changes to the tickets.

#### Send an email to [support@weka.io](mailto:support@weka.io)

To get started, sign up as a user in the Support Portal: [support.weka.io](http://support.weka.io/) (if not done yet). When you send an email, it automatically creates a ticket in the Support Portal. Problem notifications sent via email are not considered critical.

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

{% hint style="info" %}
WEKA provides only remote support as part of its SLA.&#x20;

The SLA detailed in the technical support policy is for WEKA software issues. Issues caused by faulty hardware depend on the hardware provider, and WEKA is not responsible for the hardware provider's timelines and response time.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## Recommended preparations for getting support&#x20;

* Upload information from the WEKA cluster to Weka Home for each provisioned cluster.&#x20;
* Create an account on the Weka Support Portal [support.weka.io](http://support.weka.io/). This account allows you to submit and check the status of tickets and browse our online knowledge base.

## Escalation

If you find our response to be unsatisfactory or believe that there is potential for improvement, you have the option to escalate the incident to our management team.

To initiate the escalation process, please contact WEKA Support at +1 (844) 392-0665 and select the escalation option. You can leave a voicemail stating your request for escalation of the issue.

Depending on the time of day and their respective time zones, your escalation request will be directed to one of our executive managers. We operate on a "follow the sun" approach, ensuring that one of our executive managers is available to address your escalation request.
