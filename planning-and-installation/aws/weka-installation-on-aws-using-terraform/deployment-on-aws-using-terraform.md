# Deployment on AWS using Terraform

This step-by-step procedure ensures a seamless configuration of your network, customization of Terraform configurations, and successful deployment of the WEKA cluster on AWS.

Begin by creating a `main.tf` file, tailoring it to your deployment specifics on AWS. Once the `main.tf` is configured to your satisfaction, apply the changes.

## Create a main.tf file

#### Before you begin

The [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli) must be installed on the workstation used for the deployment. Check the minimum required Terraform version specified the [**Requirements**](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/weka/weka/aws/latest#requirements) section of the Terraform-AWS-WEKA module.

#### Procedure

1. Review the [Terraform-AWS-WEKA example](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/weka/weka/aws/latest/examples/public\_network) and use it as a reference for creating the `main.tf` according to your deployment specifics on AWS.
2. Tailor the `main.tf` file to create SMB-W or NFS protocol clusters by adding the relevant code snippet. Adjust parameters like the number of gateways, instance types, domain name, and share naming:

* **SMB-W**

```makefile
smb_protocol_gateways_number = 3
smb_protocol_gateway_instance_type = "c5.2xlarge" 
smbw_enabled = true
smb_domain_name = "CUSTOMER_DOMAIN"
smb_share_name = "SPECIFY_SMB_SHARE_NAMING"
smb_setup_protocol = true
```

* **NFS**

```makefile
nfs_protocol_gateways_number = 1
nfs_protocol_gateway_instance_type = "c5.2xlarge"
nfs_setup_protocol = true
```

4. Add WEKA POSIX clients (optional)**:** If needed, add [WEKA POSIX clients](../../../weka-system-overview/weka-client-and-mount-modes.md) to support your workload by incorporating the specified variables into the `main.tf` file:

```makefile
clients_number = 2
client_instance_type = "c5.2xlarge"
```

## Apply the main.tf file

Once you complete the main.tf settings, apply it: Run `terraform apply`

## **Create a dedicated** Cluster Admin username and password

When deploying a WEKA cluster on the cloud using Terraform, a default username (admin) is automatically generated, and Terraform creates the password. Both the username and password are stored in the AWS Secrets Manager. This user facilitates communication between the cloud and the WEKA cluster, particularly during scale-up and scale-down operations.

As a best practice, itâ€™s recommended to create a dedicated local user in the WEKA cluster with the Cluster Admin role. This user will serve as a service account for cloud-cluster communications.

**Procedure**

1. Create a local user with the Cluster Admin role in the WEKA cluster.
2. In the **AWS Secrets Manager**, navigate to **Secretes**.
3. Update the `weka_username` and `weka_password` services with the username and password of the newly created local user.
4. Validate the changes by checking the [AWS Step Functions](#user-content-fn-1)[^1] execution results and ensuring they pass successfully.

If you change the password for the default username in the WEKA cluster, ensure to update the password in the `weka_password` service within AWS Secrets Manager.
