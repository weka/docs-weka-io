# TLS certificate management

TLS certificates are used to protect both the clients' information while it's in transfer and to authenticate the system identity to ensure users are interacting with legitimate system owners.

By default, the system deploys a self-signed certificate to access the GUI, CLI, and API through HTTPS.  You can deploy your certificate by providing an unencrypted private key and certificate PEM files.

The system supports TLS 1.2 and higher with at least 128-bit ciphers.
