## Remove a chart from the statistics page <a href="#remove-a-chart-from-the-statistics-page" id="remove-a-chart-from-the-statistics-page"></a>

You can remove a chart that is no longer required to free space for adding another chart to the statistics page. For example, if the Statistics page already has the maximum number of five charts.

## Set the timeframe  <a href="#set-the-timeframe" id="set-the-timeframe"></a>

The Statistics page contains a time axis for all the displayed charts. To investigate charts in a specific timeframe, you can set the interval in the time axis to the last hour, last day, or last week. You can also set a timeframe for a specific period (start and end time).

**Procedure**

1. To display the charts for the last period: **Hour**, **Day**, or **Week**, in the **Last** line, select the relevant button.
2. To display the charts for a specific period, in the **Range** line select the calendar, and set the start time and end time for the timeframe.

## Display events from a chart <a href="#display-events-from-a-chart" id="display-events-from-a-chart"></a>

If events occur during the period of the displayed charts, a purple box indicates the number of the events. To investigate the events, show and correlate them with the statistics data.

**Procedure**

1. On the time axis, select the purple box (it only appears if events occur).
2. From the popup box, select **Show All**.
