# Classic license

A classic license is a text element you create in **get.weka.io** for your specific WEKA cluster and then apply the license text to your WEKA cluster.

## Obtain a classic license from get.weka.io

**Before you begin**

* To create a classic license in get.weka.io, you need a WEKA account. If you already have a WEKA account, skip this step. If not, see instructions in [Register to get.weka.io](../planning-and-installation/bare-metal/obtaining-the-weka-install-file.md#register-to-get.weka.io).
* Obtain the cluster GUID and capacity from your system and keep it for later use.\
  Run the command `weka cluster license`.\
  The command provides an output of all the information required for creating your license.\
  \
  **Output example**

```
# weka cluster license 
Licensing status: Unlicensed

Your cluster is currently unlicensed. Please go to https://get.weka.io/ to get a license
or enroll in a subscription.

When asked, you'll need the following details to create your license:

    Cluster GUID          : bbb6639d-3eaa-483b-b532-31a560d5859d
    Raw Drive Capacity    : 11399 GB
    Usable Capacity       : 0 GB
    Object-store Capacity : 0 GB

If you already have a license, please enter it by running

    weka cluster license set <license-key>
```

**Procedure**

1. Sign in to [get.weka.io](http://get.weka.io).
2. **Obtain an entitlement:** Once you have a WEKA account, Sales Operations applies an entitlement to the account. You can view the outstanding entitlements on the account dashboard.

![Outstanding Entitlements pane](../.gitbook/assets/getwekaio\_1\_outstanding\_entitlements.png)

3\. In the Outstanding Entitlements pane, select **Create a license**.

4\. In the subsequent pane, select the line containing the entitlement for which a license is created\
&#x20;   and then select **Create a license.**

![Create a license](../.gitbook/assets/getwekaio\_2\_create\_classic\_license.png)

4\. In the Create License dialog, fill in the cluster GUID and capacities that you have obtained \
&#x20;   (as part of the Before you begin section above) and select **Create License**.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you plan a cluster expansion for the future, you can fill in capacities larger than those appearing in the Weka cluster license.

The licenses' capacities represent the limits to which it is possible to expand the cluster and do not have to match the actual usage.
{% endhint %}

## Apply the license to the cluster

After creating the license, apply the license to the cluster.

**Procedure**

1. In the Licenses tab in get.weka.io, select the three dots to the right of the license details and then select **Show License Text**.

![Show license text](../.gitbook/assets/getwekaio\_4\_show\_classic\_license\_text.png)

2\. In the License Text dialog that opens, select **copy to clipboard**.

![License text dialog](../.gitbook/assets/getwekaio\_5\_classic\_license\_text.png)

3\. On the Weka cluster, run the following command:

```
weka cluster license set <license-key>
```

Instead of the \<license-key> in the command line, paste the license copied to the clipboard.

The license is assigned to the cluster.

## Reuse an existing license on a new cluster

When installing a new cluster, it is assigned with a new GUID. You can reuse an existing license for the newly-installed cluster.

**Procedure**

1. In the Licenses tab in get.weka.io, select the three dots to the right of the license details and then select **Change Cluster GUID**.

![Show license text](../.gitbook/assets/getwekaio\_4\_show\_classic\_license\_text.png)

2\. Set the new cluster GUID and select **Save Changes**.

![Change cluster GUID](../.gitbook/assets/getwekaio\_change\_cluster\_guid.png)

3\. Apply the license with the updated GUID. See [Apply the license to the cluster](classic-licensing.md#apply-the-license-to-the-cluster).
