# NFS transport failback

## Overview

While using the native WekaFS driver as the storage connectivity layer is the recommended approach for integrating WekaFS with Kubernetes, version 2.5.0 introduces the option to utilize the WEKA CSI Plugin over NFS transport. This allows you to employ WekaFS as a storage backend for your Kubernetes cluster without requiring the installation of the WEKA client on every Kubernetes node.

### Benefits of using WEKA CSI Plugin with NFS transport

* **Simplified deployment**: Eliminate the need to install the WEKA client on each Kubernetes node.
* **Interoperability**: Use the WEKA CSI Plugin on nodes where the WEKA client is not yet installed or currently unsupported.
* **Flexibility**: Leverage the WEKA CSI Plugin with NFS transport for specific use cases while continuing to use the native WekaFS driver for others.
* **Performance**: Mount pods across multiple IPs within the same NFS interface group, maximizing performance and simplifying management.
* **Ease of migration**: Use the WEKA CSI Plugin with NFS transport as an interim solution while transitioning to the native WekaFS driver. Once the WEKA client is deployed on all nodes, you can switch to the native WekaFS driver without altering the storage configurationâ€”simply reboot the node.

### Limitations and constraints

{% hint style="danger" %}
As of version 2.5.0 and until further notice, publishing snapshot-backed volumes via NFS transport is not recommended. This is an open issue currently under investigation.
{% endhint %}

* **Feature parity**: Certain features and capabilities available with the native WekaFS driver may be absent when using the WEKA CSI Plugin with NFS transport.
* **Complexity**: NFS transport necessitates additional configuration on the WEKA cluster and may require further networking setup on the Kubernetes cluster.
* **Interoperability**: A single Kubernetes node cannot use both NFS and WekaFS transport simultaneously.
* **Migration**: Transitioning from NFS transport to WekaFS transport requires rebooting the Kubernetes nodes after the WEKA client has been deployed.
* **Network configuration**: NFS interface group IP addresses must be accessible from the Kubernetes cluster nodes.
* **Security**: NFS transport is generally less secure than the native WekaFS driver and may necessitate additional security measures.
* **Quality of Service (QoS)**: QoS is not supported with NFS transport.

### Host Network mode

The WEKA CSI Plugin installs automatically in `hostNetwork` mode when using NFS transport. `hostNetwork` mode is required for NFS transport, so the `hostNetwork` parameter in the `values.yaml` file is ignored.

### Security considerations

The WEKA CSI Plugin with NFS transport uses NFSv4.1 (default) or NFSv3 protocols to connect to the WEKA cluster. However, support for Kerberos authentication is not available in this version of the WEKA CSI Plugin. Therefore, it is recommended to use NFS transport only in secure and trusted networks.

### Interoperability with WekaFS driver

The WEKA CSI Plugin with NFS transport is fully interoperable with the native WekaFS driver. This allows you to use both WekaFS transport and NFS within the same Kubernetes cluster, including the ability to publish the same volume to different pods using different transport layers from different nodes. However, only one transport layer can be used on a single node at any given time.

#### Mount options

Mount options for NFS transport are automatically set by the WEKA CSI Plugin. When custom mount options are specified in the storage class, the WEKA CSI Plugin translates them into NFS alternatives. Any unknown or unsupported mount options are ignored.

#### QoS and performance

Quality of Service (QoS) is not supported for NFS transport. Performance is constrained by the NFS protocol and the network configuration.

#### Scheduling workloads by transport protocol

The WEKA CSI Plugin node server populates the transport protocol in the node topology. This feature enables the use of node affinity rules to direct workloads to use WekaFS transport on nodes where the WEKA client is installed. For example, in hybrid deployments where some nodes have the WEKA client installed while others do not, administrators may prefer to run storage-intensive workloads on nodes with the WEKA client, allowing more generic workloads to operate on other nodes.

To enforce a specific transport type for a workload, a `nodeSelector` can be applied in the workload manifest.

**Example: a nodeSelector for WekaFS transport**

```yaml
nodeSelector:
  topology.weka.com/transport: wekafs
```

**Example: a nodeSelector for NFS transport**

```yaml
nodeSelector:
  topology.weka.com/transport: nfs
```

#### Switching from NFS to WekaFS transport

To switch from NFS to WekaFS transport, follow these steps:

1. Install the WEKA client on the Kubernetes node.
2. Reboot the Kubernetes node.

After rebooting, the WEKA CSI Plugin automatically switches to WekaFS transport. Existing volumes can be reattached to the pods without any changes.

## Minimum prerequisites for using WEKA CSI Plugin with NFS transport

* **WEKA cluster installation**: The WEKA cluster must be installed and configured.
* **NFS protocol configuration**: The NFS protocol must be configured on the WEKA cluster.
* **NFS interface group creation**: An NFS interface group must be created on the WEKA cluster.
* **Accessibility of IP addresses**: NFS interface group IP addresses must be accessible from the Kubernetes cluster nodes.

Adhere to the following considerations:

* **Interface group name configuration**: If multiple NFS interface groups are defined, set the `pluginConfig.mountProtocol.interfaceGroupName` parameter to the desired NFS interface group name in the `values.yaml` file. If this parameter is not set, an arbitrary NFS interface group is used, which may lead to performance or networking issues.
* **NFS client group**: The plugin automatically creates an NFS client group called `WekaCSIPluginClients`. During each volume creation or publishing, the Kubernetes node IP address is added to this group.
* **IP address configuration**: While adding node IP addresses one by one is the most secure method for configuring the NFS client group, it can be cumbersome for large deployments. In such cases, it is recommended to use a network range (CIDR). Predefine the NFS client group with a network range in the WEKA cluster, then specify the NFS client group name using the `pluginConfig.mountProtocol.nfsClientGroupName` parameter in the `values.yaml` file.

## WEKA CSI Plugin operation over NFS transport

Upon starting, the WEKA CSI Plugin performs the following steps:

1. **Check WEKA client installation**: Verifies if the WEKA client is installed on the Kubernetes node.
2. **NFS failback check**:
   * If the WEKA client is not set up, the plugin checks if NFS failback is enabled or if NFS use is forced.
   * If NFS failback is enabled, the plugin uses NFS transport for volume provisioning and publishing.
   * If NFS failback is disabled, the plugin does not start and logs an error message. See the [#installation](nfs-transport-failback.md#installation "mention") section to enable NFS failback.

When NFS mode is enabled, the plugin uses NFS transport for all volume operations. For any volume creation or publishing request, the WEKA CSI plugin performs the following:

1. **Connect to WEKA Cluster API**: Fetch interface groups and their IP addresses. If an interface group name is specified in the `values.yaml` file, the plugin uses that; otherwise, it selects an arbitrary interface group.
2. **Client group verification**: Ensure the Client Group exists on the WEKA cluster. If it does not, the plugin creates it.
3. **Determine node IP address**: Identify the node IP address facing the interface group IP addresses by checking the node's network configuration. The plugin issues a UDP connection to one of the interface group IP addresses, using the determined source IP address as the node IP address.
4. **Add node IP to client group**: Confirm the node IP address is included in the Client Group. If not, the plugin adds it. If the Client Group already contains the node IP address or a matching CIDR definition, this step is skipped.
   * **Example**: For two nodes with IP addresses 192.168.100.1 and 192.168.200.1, if the Client Group has a rule for 192.168.100.0/255.255.255.0, no new rule is added for the first node. However, for the second node, a new rule 192.168.200.1/255.255.255.255 is created.
5. **Identify filesystem**: Determine the filesystem name to be mounted, either from StorageClass parameters (during provisioning) or from the Volume Handle (when publishing an existing volume).
6. **NFS permissions**: Ensure that NFS permissions are granted for the Client Group to access the filesystem. If permissions are not set, the plugin establishes them. If permissions are already in place, this step is skipped.
7. **Select random IP address**: Choose a random IP address from the selected NFS interface group to be used for mounting the filesystem.
8. **NFS mount operation**: Perform the NFS mount operation on the Kubernetes node using the selected IP address and filesystem name.
9. **Subsequent operations**:
   * Execute remaining operations similarly to how they would be done with the native WekaFS driver.
   * If a client group name is specified in the `values.yaml` file, the plugin uses that name; otherwise, it defaults to the `WekaCSIPluginClients` client group.

## NFS permissions required for WEKA CSI Plugin

The WEKA CSI Plugin requires and it sets the following NFS permissions on the WEKA cluster:

1. **Client Group**: `WekaCSIPluginClients` (or custom client group name if set in the `values.yaml` file)
2. **Filesystem**: The filesystem name to be mounted
3. **Path**: `/` (root of the filesystem)
4. **Type**: `RW`
5. **Priority**: No priority set
6. **Supported Versions**: `V3, V4`
7. **User Squash**: `None`
8. **Authentication Types**: `NONE`, `SYS`

{% hint style="warning" %}
WEKA NFS servers evaluate permissions based on the order of the permissions list. If multiple permissions match the IP address of a Kubernetes node and the filesystem, conflicts may arise.

To avoid this, refrain from creating additional permissions for the same filesystem. Additionally, if multiple client groups are in use, ensure that the IP addresses (or ranges of IP addresses) do not overlap between the client groups.
{% endhint %}

## WEKA cluster preparation

Before using the WEKA CSI Plugin with NFS transport, prepare the WEKA cluster for NFS access. This preparation involves:

* Configuring the NFS protocol on the WEKA cluster.
* Creating an NFS interface group.
* Configuring at least one Group IP address.

In cloud deployments where setting a Group IP address is not possible, you can use the WEKA server IP addresses instead. In this case, set the IP addresses through the API secret, which will replace the Group IP addresses. This configuration can be done by providing the `nfsTargetIps` parameter in the API secret. See [#example-csi-wekafs-api-secret.yaml-file](storage-class-configurations.md#example-csi-wekafs-api-secret.yaml-file "mention") for more information.

{% hint style="info" %}
Using an NFS load balancer that redirects NFS connections to multiple WEKA servers (also known as NFSv4 directory referrals) is not supported.
{% endhint %}

## Install the WEKA CSI Plugin with NFS transport

By default, the WEKA CSI Plugin components do not start if a WEKA driver is detected on a Kubernetes node. This prevents potential misconfigurations where volumes may be provisioned or published on a node without an installed WEKA client.

**Procedure**

1. **Configure NFS failback:** Explicitly configure the WEKA CSI Plugin to use NFS failback by setting the `pluginConfig.mountProtocol.allowNfsFailback` parameter to `true` in the `values.yaml` file.
2. **Set NFS transport enforcement (Optional):** If you want to enforce the use of NFS transport even when the WEKA client is installed on the node, set the `pluginConfig.mountProtocol.useNfs` parameter to `true`. This option is recommended for testing purposes only.
3. **Follow Helm hnstallation instructions:** Follow the Helm installation instructions to install the WEKA CSI Plugin. Most installation steps are similar to those for the native WekaFS driver.
4. **Set additional parameters:** Set any additional parameters in the `values.yaml` file or pass them as command-line arguments to the Helm install command.
5.  **Run the Helm install command:** Run the following example Helm install command for using NFS transport:

    {% code overflow="wrap" %}
    ```bash
    helm upgrade csi-wekafs -n csi-wekafs --create-namespace --install csi-wekafs/csi-wekafsplugin csi-wekafs \
    --set logLevel=6 \
    --set pluginConfig.mountProtocol.allowNfsFailback=true \
    --set pluginConfig.allowInsecureHttps=true \
    [ --set pluginConfig.mountProtocol.interfaceGroupName=MyInterfaceGroup \ ] 
    # optional, recommended if multiple interface groups are defined
    [ --set pluginConfig.mountProtocol.clientGroupName=MyClientGroup \ ]    
    # optional, recommended if the client group is predefined
    ```
    {% endcode %}
