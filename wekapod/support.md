# WEKApod support process

The WEKApod support process is a multi-tiered system designed to provide comprehensive assistance to customers:

1. **Initial contact**: For SuperPOD-related issues, the first point of contact is NVIDIA. They handle the initial call and provide immediate support.
2. **Direct WEKA support**: For storage-related issues, customers can contact WEKA directly. This ensures specialized assistance from the team with in-depth knowledge of the storage system.
3. **Hardware issue identification**: If a storage issue is identified as a hardware problem, WEKA ensures it is properly logged and addressed.
4. **Hardware shipment**: Once a hardware issue is confirmed, the necessary parts are shipped to the customer, ensuring quick replacement of faulty or damaged components to minimize downtime.

For NVIDIA related issues, contact the [NVIDIA enterprise support services](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/support/enterprise/).

For storage issues, contact the [WEKA Customer Success Team](../support/getting-support-for-your-weka-system.md#contact-customer-success-team).
