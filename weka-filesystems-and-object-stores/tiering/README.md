# Advanced data lifecycle management

This section explains how data lifecycle is maintained when working with a tiered WEKA system configuration, together with the options for control. The following subjects are covered:

* Advanced explanation of [time-based policies for data storage location](advanced-time-based-policies-for-data-storage-location.md).
* System behavior when [tiering, accessing or deleting data in tiered filesystems](data-management-in-tiered-filesystems.md).
* [Transition between SSD-only and tiered filesystems.](transition-between-tiered-and-ssd-only-filesystems.md)
* How to [manually pre-fetch tiered data from an object-store and release of data from SSD to the object-store](pre-fetching-from-object-store.md).
