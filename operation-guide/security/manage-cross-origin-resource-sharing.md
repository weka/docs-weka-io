# Manage Cross-Origin Resource Sharing

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a security mechanism implemented by web browsers that restricts how a web page from one domain can request resources from a different domain. This essentially defines the rules for communication between a web application and the server that hosts the resources it needs.

**Why do we need CORS?**

Imagine a scenario where a website (yourbank.com) relies on functionalities from another website (images.com) to display product images. If browsers didn't have CORS, images.com could potentially steal your login credentials from yourbank.com through a malicious script.

CORS prevents such unauthorized access by enforcing a set of rules. The server hosting the resources (images.com) can specify which websites (origins) can access them through special HTTP headers. This ensures that your sensitive data on yourbank.com remains secure.

In summary, CORS helps maintain web security by:

* **Preventing unauthorized access:** It restricts malicious websites from accessing resources on other domains.
* **Enforcing communication protocols:** It defines a clear communication channel between browsers and servers for cross-origin requests.
