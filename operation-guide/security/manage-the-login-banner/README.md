# Manage the login banner

The login banner provides a security statement or a legal message displayed on the sign-in page displayed on the GUI. The statement can be a definitive warning to any possible intruders that may want to access your system that certain types of activity are illegal, but at the same time, it also advises the authorized and legitimate users of their obligations relating to acceptable use of the system.
