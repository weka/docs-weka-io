## Set the timeframe  <a href="#set-the-timeframe" id="set-the-timeframe"></a>

The Statistics page contains a time axis for all the displayed charts. To investigate charts in a specific timeframe, you can set the interval in the time axis to the last hour, last day, or last week. You can also set a timeframe for a specific period (start and end time).

**Procedure**

1. To display the charts for the last period: **Hour**, **Day**, or **Week**, in the **Last** line, select the relevant button.
2. To display the charts for a specific period, in the **Range** line select the calendar, and set the start time and end time for the timeframe.

## Display events from a chart <a href="#display-events-from-a-chart" id="display-events-from-a-chart"></a>

If events occur during the period of the displayed charts, a purple box indicates the number of the events. To investigate the events, show and correlate them with the statistics data.

**Procedure**

1. On the time axis, select the purple box (it only appears if events occur).
2. From the popup box, select **Show All**.
