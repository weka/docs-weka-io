# Alerts

Alerts indicate problematic ongoing states that the cluster is suffering from. To dismiss an alert, you need to resolve the root cause of the alert.

The system provides the alert name, description, and corrective action for each alert.

Usually, an alert is introduced alongside an equivalent event. This can help identify the point when the problematic state occurred and its root cause.
