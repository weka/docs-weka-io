# Install the WEKA cluster using the WMS with WSA

The WEKA Management Station (WMS) is an install kit similar to an OS install disk that simplifies the installation and configuration of the WEKA cluster in an on-premises environment by deploying the WEKA Software Appliance (WSA) package on bare metal servers. The WMS installs the WEKA OS, drivers, and WEKA software automatically and unattended.

The WMS is also used for installing the monitoring tools: Local WEKA Home (LWH), WEKAmon, and SnapTool (for details, see [deploy-monitoring-tools-using-the-weka-management-station-wms.md](../../monitor-the-weka-cluster/deploy-monitoring-tools-using-the-weka-management-station-wms.md "mention").

## WMS deployment prerequisites

Using the WMS with WSA to install a WEKA cluster requires a physical server (or VM) that meets the following requirements:

* **Boot drives:** One or two identical boot drives as an installation target.
  * A system with two identical boot drives has the OS installed on mirrored partitions (LVM).
  * A system with one drive has a simple partition.
* **Minimum boot drive capacity:**
  * If not configuring LWH: SSD 125 GiB.
  * If configuring LWH: See the SSD-backed storage requirements section in [#1.-verify-prerequisites](../../monitor-the-weka-cluster/the-wekaio-support-cloud/local-weka-home-deployment.md#1.-verify-prerequisites "mention").
* **Boot type:** UEFI boot.
* **Cores and RAM:**
  * If not configuring LWH: minimum 4 cores and 16 GiB.
  * If configuring LWH, see the Server minimum CPU and RAM requirements section in [#1.-verify-prerequisites](../../monitor-the-weka-cluster/the-wekaio-support-cloud/local-weka-home-deployment.md#1.-verify-prerequisites "mention").
* **Network interface:** 1 Gbps.

### Prerequisites for the target bare metal servers

* Target servers must be **Dell, HPE,** **Supermicro,** or **Lenovo**. Other servers are not supported.
* The RedFish[^1] interface must be installed, enabled, and licensed for all target servers.
* The WMS must be able to connect over Ethernet to the following servers’ interfaces:
  * OS management interface, typically 1 Gbps. It must be connected to a switch.
  * Base Management Controller (BMC), such as IPMI[^2], iDRAC[^3], or iLO[^4] interfaces. The BMC interface must be configured with an IP address.&#x20;
* All the servers' dataplane[^5] interfaces must be connected to the switches.
* The bare metal servers must conform to the [prerequisites-and-compatibility.md](../prerequisites-and-compatibility.md "mention").
* The bare metal servers must have an OS management network interface for administering the servers.
* The boot type must be set to UEFI boot.

{% hint style="success" %}
For cluster configurations exceeding 25 servers, it’s advisable to equip the WMS with an ETH interface of superior speed, such as 10/25/50 Gbps, during the installation phase. As an alternative, you could bond two or more 1 Gbps interfaces to increase the bandwidth. Once the installation phase is completed, a bandwidth of 1 Gbps is sufficient.
{% endhint %}

## Before you begin

Before deploying the WMS, adhere to the following:

* Obtain the WMS package. For details, see [obtaining-the-weka-install-file.md](obtaining-the-weka-install-file.md "mention").
* The root password is `WekaService`
* The WEKA user password is `weka.io123`
* If errors occur during installation and the installation halts (no error messages appear), use the system console to review the logs in `/tmp`. The primary log is `/tmp/ks-pre.log`.
* To get a command prompt from the Installation GUI, do one of the following:
  * On macOS, type **ctrl+option+f2**&#x20;
  * On Windows, type **ctrl+alt+f2**.

## WMS deployment workflow

1. [Install the WMS](install-the-weka-cluster-using-the-wms-with-wsa.md#1.-install-the-wms)
2. [Configure the WMS](install-the-weka-cluster-using-the-wms-with-wsa.md#2.-configure-the-wms)
3. [Add the WSA package to the WMS](install-the-weka-cluster-using-the-wms-with-wsa.md#3.-add-the-wsa-package-to-the-wms)
4. [Install a WEKA Cluster](install-the-weka-cluster-using-the-wms-with-wsa.md#4.-install-a-weka-cluster)

### 1. Install the WMS

1. Boot the server from the WMS image. The following are some options to do that:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Copy to a mountable location" %}
Copy the WEKA Management Station ISO image to an appropriate location so the server’s BMC (Baseboard Management Controller) can mount it or be served through a PXE (Preboot Execution Environment).
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="See server documentation" %}
Depending on the server manufacturer, consult the documentation for the server’s BMC (for example, iLO, iDRAC, and IPMI) for detailed instructions on mounting and booting from a bootable ISO image, such as:

* A workstation or laptop sent to the BMC through the web browser.
* Ann SMB share in a Windows server or a Samba server.
* An NFS share.&#x20;
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Use PXE boot" %}
To use PXE boot, use the WEKA Management Station as any other Operating System ISO image and configure accordingly.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Create a DVD " %}
Burn the WMS image to a DVD and boot it from the physical DVD. However, most modern servers do not have DVD readers anymore.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Use a bootable USB drive" %}
A bootable USB drive should work (follow online directions for creating a bootable USB drive) but has not been tested yet.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

Once you boot the server, the WEKA Management Station installs the WEKA OS (Rocky Linux), drivers, and WEKA software automatically and unattended (no human interaction required).

Depending on network speed, this can take about 10-60 mins (or more) per server.

### 2. Configure the WMS

Once the WMS installation is complete and rebooted, configure the WMS.

1. Run the OS using one of the following options:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="BMC’s Console" %}
Run the OS through the BMC’s Console. See the specific manufacturer’s BMC documentation.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Cockpit Web Interface" %}
Run the OS through the Cockpit Web Interface on port 9090 of the OS management network.

If you don’t know the WMS hostname or IP address, go to the console and press the **Return** key a couple of times until it prompts the URL of the WMS OS Web Console (Cockpit) on port 9090.

Change the port from 9090 to 8051, which is the WMS Admin port.

**Alternative OS and dataplane configuration**

These commands only need to be run if you did not follow step 11 above.

1. Connect to one of the cluster servers to run the post-install scripts. The tools are in the same location:  `/opt/tools/install` on the WSA as they are on the WMS.&#x20;

```bash
ssh root@<wms ip>
```

2. When prompted, enter the password `WekaService`
3. Change the directory to `/opt/ansible-install` by running the following command:

```bash
cd /opt/ansible-install
# ./install_after_wsa_iso.sh
```

4. Run the post-install script:&#x20;

```bash
./install_after_wsa_iso.sh
```

Example:

```bash
$ ssh root@172.29.5.172
root@172.29.5.172's password:
X11 forwarding request failed on channel 0
